# Kernel Methods challenge at MVA

Authors: Alicia Fortes Machado & Agathe Senellart

Github repository with methods implemented from scratch from the data challenge from the Kernel Methods course at MVA.

In order to run our code, after cloning the repository, you have to follow these steps:

```
$ cd kernel_challenge
$ pip install -e .
$ python start.py
```

Data should be inside the folder kernel_challenge for it to run out of the box. If your data is elsewhere, you change the data path directly on `start.py` or on any file you are running.
